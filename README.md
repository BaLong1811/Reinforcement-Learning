# SEMTM0016 Artificial Intelligence for Robotics Coursework

This repository contains coursework submissions for the SEMTM0016 Artificial Intelligence for Robotics module. The repository is structured into three main folders:

* **Coursework A:** Implementation of supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
* **Coursework B:** Maze-solving project inspired by the Dungeon Maze World environment.
* **Coursework C:** Advanced maze-solving and reinforcement learning tasks, building on Coursework B.

## Coursework A - Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

In this section, various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are implemented to analyze and classify data collected from the Dungeon Maze World environment. This includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

* **Data:** Contains the datasets used for training and testing.
* **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for model implementation and analysis.
* **Models:** Saved models for reuse and evaluation.

## Coursework B - Maze Solving

This section focuses on implementing basic maze-solving algorithms inspired by the [Dungeon Maze World repository](https://github.com/uobcll/SEMTM0016_DungeonMazeWorld). The goal is to develop a baseline agent capable of navigating the maze effectively.

* **Environment:** Contains the customized Dungeon Maze World environment.
* **Agent:** Implementation of the baseline agent.
* **Scripts:** Scripts for running the environment and evaluating the agent.

## Coursework C - Advanced Maze Solving

Building on the baseline implementation from Coursework B, this section introduces advanced reinforcement learning algorithms to further enhance the maze-solving capabilities of the agent.

* **Environment:** Enhanced or modified environment setup.
* **Advanced Agent:** Implementation of advanced learning algorithms such as Policy Iteration and Value Iteration.
* **Evaluation:** Scripts for evaluating and visualizing the agent's performance.

<!-- ## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SEMTM0016_Coursework
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebooks in `Coursework_A` to train and evaluate supervised and unsupervised learning models.

4. Navigate to `Coursework_B` or `Coursework_C` to run the maze-solving agents:

   ```bash
   cd Coursework_B
   python run_agent.py
   ``` -->
